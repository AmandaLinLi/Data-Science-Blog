# Database Used

COVID-19 Dataset:Number of Confirmed, Death and Recovered cases every day across the globe

# Motivations for the project:

## Primary motivation: 

- 1.  To demonstrate the top 10 countries with the greatest number of total confirmed cases and deaths of Covid-19
- 2.  To show and compare total confirmed vs. confirmed/million people, and total deaths vs. deaths/million people of Covid-19 in each WHO region
- 3.  To visualize deaths/100 cases and recovered/100 cases of Covid-19 among countries in each WHO regions

## Secondary Motivation
- Using machine linearing (liear regression) method to show how some factors of interests contribute to death/100 cases
